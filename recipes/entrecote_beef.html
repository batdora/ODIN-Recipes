    <h1>Entrecote Beef Recipe</h1>
        <p><strong>Entrecote</strong> is a premium cut of beef steak taken from the rib area, typically between the 9th and 11th ribs. It’s known for its tenderness, rich marbling, and deep flavor. Often grilled or pan-seared, entrecôte is best served medium-rare to preserve its juiciness and texture. In French cuisine, it's a classic bistro steak, commonly accompanied by sauces like béarnaise or peppercorn.</p>
