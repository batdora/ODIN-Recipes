        <h1>Mantı Recipe</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Mantı</strong> is a traditional Turkish dish made of small dumplings filled with spiced minced meat, typically served with a garlic yogurt sauce and a drizzle of tomato or butter sauce. It's often topped with sumac, dried mint, or red pepper flakes. Think of it as Türkiye’s version of ravioli — smaller, spicier, and yogurt-based.
